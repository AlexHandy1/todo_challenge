As a forgetful person
I want to store my tasks
So that I don't forget them

As a person with limited time
I want to instantly be able to update my todo list (adding and changing entries)
So that I have more time to think about other things

As a person who actually gets stuff done
I want to mark my tasks as done
So that I don't do them twice

As a person with a lot of tasks
I want to be able to filter my tasks by "All", "Active", "Complete"
So that I only see the relevant tasks

As a person who doesn't like counting by hand
I want to see a total number of tasks
So that I don't have to count

As someone who has done lots of stuff
I want to be able to clear my completed tasks
So I never see them again

Plan

- Add basic html components
- Set-up basic app module + links to HTML
- Write test for showing a list of stored items
- Build controller that has a function (through factory) when click on add then pushes that term into an array which is then added to an ng-repeat list
- Write test for showing removed list of stored items
- Build factory method that can remove (pop-off from array or take selected item index to remove item)
- Write test for a checkbox
- Look into checkbox implementation/ design

Potential Blockers
- Protractor and Karma testing syntax
- Implementing checkboxes for completion of tasks
- Implementing Filters in angular
- Travis set-up
